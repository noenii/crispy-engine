i like computers =D


progress:

10/8/25: i've known python for awhile, i'm an advanced beginner...

10/9/25: did some projects

10/10/25: i'm gonna revise a bit

10/11/25: learning python structure, functions, data types, variables, I/O, operators, keywords, logic, and loops

10/12/25: learning user functions, control flow, global & local, recursion, args and kwargs, self, some stuff about classes, lambda, useful functions and nesting

10/14/25: learning strings and lists

10/17/25: learnt about tuples, dictionaries, sets, arrays, list magic, collections and heaps

10/19/25: tryna learn oop

10/21/25: learning oop

10/22/25: learning classes, objects, inheritance

10/23/25: learning polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, try/except, file handling and os

10/27/25: doing some leetcode

11/3/25: experimenting with bpy

11/4/25: did a lot of leetcode

11/6/25: coded a blender shader

11/7/25: released animeShader v.1.1.0

11/8/25: wrote my fav sorting algo, radix sort =D

11/9/25: started learning C

11/10/25: learned C syntax, statements, io, comments, variables, data types, conversion, constants, operators, booleans, if/else, switch, loops and flow 

11/11/25: learned C arrays, strings, user input, memory, addresses, pointers, arithmetic, functions, parameters, scope, declaration, math and inlines

11/12/25: learned function pointers/arrays, callback functions

11/14/25: learned file management/structures

11/15/25: learning memory management

11/16/25: learnt about heaps and stacks

11/17/25: learned memory allocation, reallocation, deallocation, dynamic structs and arrays. also turned 16 today =D

11/18/25: learned errors types, debugging, NULL, error handling and input validation

11/19/25: creating dynamic arrays, pointer black magic, random number guesser/gen, and a binary search algorithm for it =D

11/20/25: created a file handler and calculator

11/21/25: created linked lists and arrays

11/22/25: created fibonaci sequence, and learning sorting algorithms: bubblesort, selection sort, insertion sort, binary search...

11/23/25: insertion sort, counting sort...

11/24/25: radix sort, merge sort, linear search. also created stacks...

11/25/25: and queues =P

12/1/25: learning about trees

12/3/25: created a tree, and a tictactoe game ^v^

12/13/25: created a full working binary tree

12/22/25: learnt more about trees, traversal algos, management and created a BST

12/23/25: finished learning on trees with creating an AVLs =D

12/24/25: learnt about graphs and goto, and tried learning C++... spoiler: im not gonna try it again lmao

12/25/25: ok i couldnt help myself, started learning C++. learnt its syntax, I/O, date types, operators, strings, user input, arrays, namespace, functions, booleans, logic, conditionals, loops, flow, a bit of vectors, structs, enums, references, pointers, memory management...

12/26/25: functions, params, overloading, scope, recursion, lambda, some OOP, classes/objects, methods, constructors, access specifiers, encapsulation, friend function, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, file management, ctime, errors, debugging, exceptions and validation

12/29/25: did some leetcode and time complexity analysis of my bubble sort and counting sort implementations
