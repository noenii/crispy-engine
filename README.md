ive been fascinated with computers since i first watched tom scott's "the basics" when i was 9, and now ive decided to commit to cs

my journey:

10/8/2025: i've known python for awhile, i'm like an advanced beginner...

10/9/2025: didn't have much time today, but did some projects

10/10/2025: i don't really understand, i'm going to relearn everything

10/11/2025: learning python structure, functions, data types, variables, I/O, operators, keywords, logic, and loops

10/12/2025: learning user functions, control flow, global & local, recursion, args and kwargs, self, some stuff about classes, lambda, useful functions, nesting
