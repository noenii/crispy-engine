//default c file
#include <stdio.h>  //include is basically import from python

//c ignores empty lines

int main () {   //a function

    //code in here will be executed

    return 0;   //return 0 ends the main function (also return 0 is basically 200 OK :> any other number signals an error)

}   //end of main()

//c syntax: semicolons to end a statement
