#You can make your own functions too, there are many reasons for doing so such as:
#Reusability, Modularity, Readability, Maintainability

def add(num1=1, num2=1):
    #code that will be executed
    return num1 + num2

print(add(1, 1))

#you can also specify the parameters so order doesnt better
#can also nest functions
#theres also lambda functions which are basically a shorter way to define functions
#functions also call themselves for recursion
#pass is as a placeholder for functions but also loops and classes
